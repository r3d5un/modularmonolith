# The Modular Monolith

*The Modular Monolith* is a reference project demonstrating how to design large Go applications with modules.

The goal is to be able to reuse functionality through shared libraries and *intermodule* communication through interfaces. In effect, getting the best of both from a monolithic and microservice architecture.
